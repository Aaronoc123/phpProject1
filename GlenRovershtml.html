                The new club was closely linked with the local St. Nicholas' Gaelic Football Club on the north side of Cork city. 
                Both clubs are based in a strong, tough, working-class area of the city.
                These factors have contributed to the unique 'spirit of the Glen' that has existed in the area since the very beginning.
                From its foundation the club competed at both minor and junior levels. Success came quickly to the club as county minor titles were won in 1922 and 1923, 
                followed by a county junior title in 1924 and a county intermediate title in 1925.
